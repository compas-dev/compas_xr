.. Write project description

COMPAS XR facilitates XR workflows to foster the application of XR technologies both in research and teaching. It provides interfaces to existing state-of-the-art libraries and software platforms in the XR field (such as NVIDIA Omniverseâ„¢), and makes them accessible from within the parametric CAD environment. Compas XR tackles two main problems data conversion (e.g USD, GLB support) and interaction. The package builds upon COMPAS, an open-source Python-based framework for collaboration and research in architecture, engineering and digital fabrication.

Installation
------------

Tell Kit to use your python instead: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/py/kit/docs/guide/faq.html

Find :code:`kit-core.json` file. For example:

::

    C:\Users\3duser\AppData\Local\ov\pkg\create 2020.3.2\_build\kit_release\_build\windows-x86_64\release\config\kit-core.json


It has the :code:`/plugins/carb.scripting-python.plugin/pythonHome` key set to use its embedded python.
Change it to your python installation, for instance:

::

    "pythonHome": "C:/Users/3duser/.conda/envs/xr"
