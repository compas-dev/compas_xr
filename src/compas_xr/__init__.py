COMPAS XR facilitates XR workflows to foster the application of XR technologies both in research and teaching. 
It provides interfaces to existing state-of-the-art libraries and software platforms in the XR field (such as NVIDIA Omniverseâ„¢), 
and makes them accessible from within the parametric CAD environment. 

Compas XR tackles two core problems: data conversion (e.g USD, GLB support) and (-soon to come-) interaction. 
The package builds upon COMPAS, an open-source Python-based framework for collaboration and research in architecture, 
engineering and digital fabrication.
